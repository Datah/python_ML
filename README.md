# python_ML
Python ML implementations, for practice and fun. So far, OLS and logistic regression using shared core components. The regression_core.py script can be adapted to serve as the core of any least squares regression engine by simply defining a new function and its derivatives. Also, different cost functions (not least squares) can be easily substituted.
